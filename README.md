Performing an optimization using evolutionary strategies for a given set of data 'AIData.dat'


Algorithm
1. Create the initial population
2. Create random sigmas
3. Create parents from the initial population
4. Evaluate the fitness of each individual of parents
5. Mutate
6. Evaluate the fitness after mutation
7. If the fitness after mutation is worse GOTO 9
8. Substitute parents with offsprings
9. Check the fitness of the whole population and find the best 𝜇
10. Create a new initial population from the parents
